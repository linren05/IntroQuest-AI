📘 IntroQuest AI — Local Machine Installation Guide (Detailed)

Follow this step-by-step guide to run the app smoothly on your computer.

🖥 1. Install Python (Required)
✅ Python version required: Python 3.10 – 3.12

(Do NOT use Python 3.13 because many AI libraries are not yet compatible.)

✔ Steps:

Download Python from the official website:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

During installation, check the box:
☑ Add Python to PATH

Verify installation:

python --version


You should see something like:

Python 3.11.6

📂 2. Download the Project
Option A — From GitHub (recommended)

Open terminal / PowerShell:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/introquest-ai.git
cd introquest-ai

Option B — Zip download

Go to your GitHub repo
